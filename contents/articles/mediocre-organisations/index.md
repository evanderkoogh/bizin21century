Maria Popova wrote a [review](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/22/daniel-goleman-focus-10000-hours-myth/) of Daniel Goleman's latest book [Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062114867/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062114867&linkCode=as2&tag=lightmedia-20) about how humans learn on her excellent website [Brain Pickings](http://www.brainpickings.org). And that got me thinking; Can we draw parallels between how humans and organisations learn?

## Three ingredients for achieving excellence

In Outliers Malcolm Gladwell popularised the idea that we need to practice for 10,000 hours to achieve mastery level at an activity. But in his book Daniel shows that is only half of the answer.
There are three other things that are needed to achieve excellence.

### Deliberate Practice

> “You don’t get benefits from mechanical repetition, but by adjusting your execution over and over to get closer to your goal.”

It is not enough to do the same thing over and over. Deliberate practice is to keep pushing the envelope and keep trying increasingly harder things as you get better. This means your error rate should stay pretty constant.  

Unfortunately organisations have a phobia and deep hatred for anything resembling failures or errors. With this aversion to errors it is next to impossible to learn anything.  
If we are luck we have a R&D department or even a [Skunkworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works) department where some errors are tolerated and some learning happens, but it is extremely hard to get that learning into the rest of the organisation.

### Feedback loops

> Ideally that feedback comes from someone with an expert eye and so every world-class sports champion has a coach. If you practice without such feedback, you don’t get to the top ranks.

Proper feedback loops are hard to find in most organisations. Most organisations have functional departments and front & back offices. It is very hard for feedback to filter back through where an error happened. We also have a tendency to deal with failures in the aggregate: "We had a defect percentage of only 0.2% this month." And when we do link up an error with the action that caused it, we usually just slap someone's wrist or fix it by creating a policy to prevent the symptom.

And what would a coach look like for an entire organisation? What role should he have?

### Focus

> Amateurs are content at some point to let their efforts become bottom-up operations. After about fifty hours of training — whether in skiing or driving — people get to that “good-enough” performance level, where they can go through the motions more or less effortlessly. They no longer feel the need for concentrated practice, but are content to coast on what they’ve learned.

That *coasting along* perfectly describes quite a few organisations and departments I have seen. The focus is not on becoming excellent & the best we could be. It is to be good enough to meet targets & KPIs.

## Toyota

So let's take a look at one of the organisations that is best at learning: **Toyota**.  

For **deliberate practice** Toyota has an employee suggestion system. But no, not like the one you have in your company. They have generated **[20 million ideas in 40 years](http://api.ning.com/files/MgLSaDU9RzqQ7yZRsQouT2*hRC*8-T9K3lX8RbsTEek_/40YEARS.pdf)** with it. And most of those ideas have been tried.

So what **feedback loops** do they have? The most badass one: *"Stop the line"*. If an error is detected they stop the entire assembly line. This counter-intuitive rule (stopping an assembly line costs a *huge* amount of money) prevents errors from propagating. It forces them to deal with the error as it happens.

And last but not least **focus**. Whenever something does go wrong instead of burying it and continuing business as usual Toyota will try to find a root-cause. They have developed many techniques for really getting to the root of the problem, suggesting actions and measuring their effectiveness. One of the more famous ones that combines all of that is [A3 Problem Solving](http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/22984/a3-problem-solving-lean).

### But we do Lean as well!

No you don't.
The success of the [Toyota Production System](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071392319/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071392319&linkCode=as2&tag=lightmedia-20) gave rise to a movement called [Lean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing). However almost all organisations implementing Lean are doing it to 'Reduce Waste': Trying to do the same things with less resources (euphemism for less people). Toyota on the other hand is focussed on improving the entire organisation and its people, especially in the long run.

## Conclusion

If we are to survive & even thrive in the [different reality of the 21<sup>st</sup> century](/articles/what-is-so-different-about-21st-century/) we will need to create learning organisations. Organisations with a purpose and a focus on experimentation and learning. Is the key to creating such organisations to focus on **deliberate practice**, tight **feedback loops** and **focus**?
