My wife recently found a site ([Postcrossing](http://www.postcrossing.com)) that in a perfectly rational world could & would not exist. It is a website that makes it easy for complete strangers to send each other physical postcards.  
Luckily we are not living in a perfectly rational world and there are **500,000** random strangers from **216** countries in the world who have send **22 million** postcards to other random strangers for a grand total distance of **110 trillion!** km: That is **2.8 million** laps around the world.
This was technically impossible 15 years ago and infeasible 5-10 years ago. But in many ways it is extremely successful.  
So I was intrigued: What has changed? What is there to learn from Postcrossing?

## The Long Tail

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail#Chris_Anderson_and_Clay_Shirky">![image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Long_tail.svg/320px-Long_tail.svg.png)</a>
[The Long Tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail#Chris_Anderson_and_Clay_Shirky) is a term coined by Clay Shirky & popularized by Chris Anderson, which wrote a book called: [The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q9E9F6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001Q9E9F6&linkCode=as2&tag=lightmedia-20). The moral of the story is that with the scale of the internet you don't need to have a block buster.  In the picture the areas in green and yellow are equivalent in size.  
So feel free to target a niche market, it is less crowded and you are able to really delight your customers.

## Passive Income

Postcrossing won't be very remarkable because of their huge revenues. I am no internet advertising expert, but between the ads, some affiliate links on the blog and donations they won't be millionaires anytime soon, but they should make more than the site costs to run and make a profit.  
What is an extreme shift though is that it is now easier than ever in history for anyone to earn passive income. Income that is not directly related to the hours you put in. 
Money probably wasn't the main motivator to start Postcrossing, but by making some money they make it very sustainable for the future.

## Social

Everyone is talking about the value of 'social'. And Postcrossing is a perfect example that you do not need to compete with Facebook to do something with it.
There are a couple of things they do really well:

### Community

Postcrossing is not so much a business, but a community of like-minded individuals who enjoy being part of it. This quote on [this blog](http://www.postcrossing.com/blog/2013/11/25/postcrossing-connections-telenn-and-amit-s-story) entry sums it up quite nicely:
>Postcrossing isn't just a website, it's a beautiful world within this world where a big family lives, meets, smiles, discusses and has lots of fun together...

What are the changes of someone like this going to the competitor because they are having a 10% discount?

### Building in trust

To achieve a sense of community you need people in it that can trust each other. The genius trick Postcrossing uses to build trust from the beginning? You won't receive any postcards yourself unless someone has confirmed the receipt of your postcard.  
They do offer the option of swapping cards with specific people, but they also give you information to base a decision whether or not to trust them. How many cards have they send? How long have they been active etc.  

### User Generated Content

Another thing they do well is that except for the blog almost all content is user generated. Obviously the post cards themselves, but there is a forum for the community to come together and they have a gallery for people to browse through hundreds of post cards.  
This is same principle that Wikipedia is build on. A community of users can generate many times the content you can.

## Conclusion

I love the idea of Postcrossing. It is one of those things that couldn't really exist 10-15 years ago. Grown from a small passionate core into a big community that should now be self-supporting. We are going to be seeing a lot more of these 'businesses'. People like Chris Guillebeau (of [The $100 Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307951529/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307951529&linkCode=as2&tag=lightmedia-20) fame) who have never even had a 'real' job and monetise their audience directly without an employer.  
No company would every have invested the required time, energy & money into it. But because all the tools are out there for everyone to use, you don't need a big company to make things like this happen. This is an exciting century to live in!
