Quartz [just broke the news](http://qz.com/161210/zappos-is-going-holacratic-no-job-titles-no-managers-no-hierarchy/) that Zappos, an online retailer of shoes and already a poster boy for awesome culture (Their motto is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446563048/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0446563048&linkCode=as2&tag=lightmedia-20">Delivering Happiness</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lightmedia-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0446563048" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />), is taking things to the next level.  
At their all-hands in November CEO Tony Hsieh announced they are going to get rid of their hierarchies and adopt [Holacracy](http://holacracy.org).  
This is going to be a huge step not just for Zappos, but also for Holacracy, which has seen traction in smaller companies, but nothing on this scale as far as I know.

HolacracyOne, the company behind the Holacracy concept, describes Holacracy as a **social technology** for *agile* & *purposeful* organisations. It does away with hierarchy and instead focusses amongst others on clear delegation of authority. This allows everyone in an organisation to be a leader.

It is hard to understate the importance of this. An established, publicly traded, billion dollar company with 1500 employees doing away with hierarchy and managers (not *management*) is a big step in the recognition that we all need to radically rethink the way we do business. 

Holacracy was also mentioned in a recent article by [Aaron Dignan](https://twitter.com/aarondignan) called [The Last Re-org You Will Ever Do](https://medium.com/p/f19160f61500) as one of the 3 organisational structures of the future. Along with Agile Squads (popularised by Spotify) & Completely Flat (popularised by Valve & Github). What the structures have in common is that everyone in the organisation can make a difference and be a leader. What the companies have in common is that they are successful, highly innovative and often disruptive companies. 

It is extremely exciting to see more & more organisations adopting radical new ways of organising, interacting with company cultures and innovating with business models.
The 21<sup>st</sup> century [is really different](/articles/what-is-so-different-about-21st-century/) and we do need to rethink the way we do business. But luckily we can look at organisations like Zappos & many others for guidance & inspiration.
