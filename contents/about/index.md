### Our mission

Is to drag management thinking into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Current management thinking is still largely based on the Scientific Management, pioneered by Frederick Winston Taylor called in late 1800s. Don't get me wrong, it is very hard to overstate just how important a role it played in creating our current prosperity. But while management theory has been tweaked here and there, the world around it has been changed completely.
It is no wonder we are in the mess we are in. We are still using techniques that rely on a predictable, partitioned, linear, bell-curve world, while are living in an unpredictable, integrated, exponential, power-law world.

This 'new' reality comes with a huge set of challenges, but an even bigger set of opportunities for everyone. Traditional boundaries are all coming tumbling down: Economies of scale are losing their importance, capital requirements to start a business have plummeted, information and education is more accessible than ever and barriers to entry to crumbling everywhere and power is shifting from companies to consumers. The playing field has never been this level.
One of the biggest tradegies is that we unable to take proper advantage of these opportunities. Research shows just 11% of the working population is engaged at work. People just don't care enough. And managers are very ill-prepared to deal with unpredictability and uncertainty.

But here's the great news: __We know how to do it__. There are tons of books, research papers and even examples of companies who are doing things differently.
We know what it takes to get people engaged. We know what we need to do to deal with uncertainty. It is just not standard practice yet.

I truly believe that we can solve our current problems; recession, climate change & hunger to name just a few if we can get enough people engaged. And to do that we need to change how we think about business. We will need that to survive & thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
