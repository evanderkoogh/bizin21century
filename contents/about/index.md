## Change is changing

It is not just that the world is changing at a frightening pace, but it is also changing the in a lot of other dimensions as well.
A famour example of that is Moore's Law, which still holds true almost 50 years later. A doubling of processor capacity every 2 years.
But it is also the cost of that hardware. 1GB of storage for example cost $200,000 back in 1980. Today it is $0.063.  

But the most fundamental shift is the one shifting of the power. It is shifting from big corporations to both customers and small producers.
Technologies like social media, crowd funding, self-publishing, app stores, online marketplaces, comparison sites and many others have completely leveled the playing field and even gave the home field advantage to consumers and independent producers.

## So what do we do about it?

We have to radically rethink on how to do business in the 21st century. The only real competitive advantage that will be left is the ability to learn and to put those learnings into action. Unfortunately most current organisations are designed for the almost the exact opposite. To execute a given process as efficiently as possible.

The good news is that there are already quite a few examples of companies that are adapting to this new reality. And a lot has been written about it. Our mission is to spread the news and inspire others to adapt the way they work to survive & thrive in the 21st century.
