# Why big traditional companies can no longer survive

In 1937 economist [Ronald Coase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase) asked himself two important questions:

* Why do firms exist? and
* Why do they grow to a certain size?

He wrote his views in the ground-breaking paper "[The Nature of the Firm](http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/eb/alston/econ4504/readings/The%20Nature%20of%20the%20Firm%20by%20Coase.pdf)", which laid the groundwork for his Nobel Prize, which he received in 1991. His theory, later called the [Transaction Cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost) Theory, explains that the size of a firm is a function of the 'cost of going to market' vs the 'cost of doing it internally'.
The problem is that the cost of going to market has radically changed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

## Transaction Cost

So given that we have a free market, why would we have firms? He quickly disposed of the theories that people just like being bossed around, or like to boss people around. He proposed the concept of transaction cost. The cost of buying something externally is more than just the price you pay for the item or service. And it is this difference that allows for scaled efficiency.
Transaction cost has 3 components:

* Search & Information cost for finding the best price.
* Negotiating & Agreeing on terms & a contract.
* Monitoring & Policing of the terms of the contract.

The internal cost is the cost of the raw materials/labor plus all coordinating costs.
So as long as the cost of doing it internally is less than the cost of buying the item on the market plus the transaction cost, it makes sense to do it in a firm.

But that leaves one big question unanswered. If buying in the open market is so expensive, why do we not have 1 huge firm that does everything internally? This is where it gets interesting. The bigger your company the higher your coordination costs. Coase called it "The diminishing returns on management."

## So what changed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century?

The big difference in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is that Transaction Costs have plummeted:

* Websites/Online businesses & search engines have made finding suppliers & prices effortless
* Collaborating tools like Video Conferencing are next to free.
* Reputation information is available online and automated KPI dashboards have made monitoring & policing less needed and cheaper to do respectively.

The problem is that coordination cost can't keep up in our current organisations. With our hierarchies & functional divisions the cost of coordination over those silos might improve by 10%, but it is not going to get orders of magnitude better.   
It leads to weird situations where you have to wait 5 working days for a server from the IT department, when you can rent one at Amazon for a fraction or the cost instantly.
Or that your department gets charged double the price you would pay in the corner store for stationary.

## What now?

If efficiency is no longer a valid reason to organise in firms? What are we to do?



We need to move from a model of scalable efficiency to a model of scaled learning.
